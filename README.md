<h1>Welcome to my Github üëã</h1>
<div>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In 2017 I finished my degree in Early Childhood Education and I was working in the world of education. In 2022 I decided to change my career and train as a programmer. After passing the selection process, I entered as a student in 42 Barcelona, a campus with a gamified and peer-to-peer methodology. This methodology requires cooperation, effort and perseverance to advance. Currently, I am still training and looking for experiences to improve and get my maximum potential as a programmer.</p>
